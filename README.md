srtla - SRT transport proxy with link aggregation for connection bonding
=====

This fork ports srtla_send to macOS.

=====

This tool can transport [SRT](https://github.com/Haivision/srt/) traffic over multiple network links for capacity aggregation and redundancy. Traffic is balanced dynamically, depending on the network conditions. The intended application is bonding mobile modems for live streaming.

This application is experimental. Be prepared to troubleshoot it and experiment with various settings for your needs.
